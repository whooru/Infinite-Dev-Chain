# Infinite Dev Chain

**Infinite Dev Chain** is an open-source collaborative coding game for developers.  
The idea is simple: every player contributes a small piece of code to the project â€” in any language they like â€” and passes the turn to the next developer.  
Over time, the repository becomes a fun, chaotic, multilingual codebase that grows infinitely.

## How it works
1. **Pick a language** you want to write in â€” Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Go, Rust, etc.
2. **Add a new file** (or extend an existing one) with a small, self-contained piece of code or abstraction.
3. **Commit & open a Pull Request**.
4. Once merged, your contribution becomes part of the chain.

## ðŸ“œ Rules
- At the **early stage** prefer adding **interfaces, abstractions, and core building blocks** to form a strong foundation.
- Each commit should add **something functional** â€” a function, a class, or a runnable snippet.
- Keep files lightweight and avoid breaking existing examples.
- You can build on top of previous code or start something new.
- Be creative â€” the point is to make it fun!
- Follow the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## ðŸ§© Game phases
The project evolves in stages â€” from setup, to early gameplay, to strict CI enforcement, and eventually scoring.  
See [Game Phases](docs/game-phases.md) for details.

## Why participate?
- Practice coding in different languages.
- Explore how others approach problems.
- Contribute to a growing, multilingual code playground.
- Have fun and experiment without pressure.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-contribution
   ```
3. Make your change, commit, and open a Pull Request.
