# Infinite Dev Chain

**Infinite Dev Chain** is an open-source collaborative coding game for developers.  
The idea is simple: every player contributes a small piece of code to the project — in any language they like — and passes the turn to the next developer.  
Over time, the repository becomes a fun, chaotic, multilingual codebase that grows infinitely.

## How it works
1. **Pick a language** you want to write in — Python, JavaScript, Go, Kotlin, C++, Rust, anything!
2. **Add a new file** (or extend an existing one) with a small, self-contained piece of code.
3. **Commit & open a Pull Request**.
4. Once merged, your contribution becomes part of the chain.

## Rules
- Each commit should add **something functional** — a function, a class, a snippet that can run or demonstrate something.
- Keep files **lightweight** and avoid breaking existing examples.
- You can **build on top** of previous code or start something new.
- Be creative — the point is to make it fun!

## Project structure

## Why participate?
- Practice coding in different languages.
- Explore how others approach problems.
- Contribute to a growing, multilingual code playground.
- Have fun and experiment without pressure.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-contribution
